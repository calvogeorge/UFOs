# UFOs
The truth is out there!

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to an easy-to-use web application where the data from the research project generously funded by W. Avy can be display. Since the research there is a lot of data, the web app will provide the users with the ability to filter by several parameter, such as: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.
Users will be able to use as many, or as little of the filters parameters so they can dig thru the data how they like and arrive to the conclusion: Are we alone in the universe?

## Results
To display the results, we have deployed the web app using github pages, to visit site user can go the url: https://calvogeorge.github.io/UFOs/,  where the webapp as show on the image below will load.

The main components of the webapp are a navigation bar on the top (“UFO Sightings”) which allows the user to reload the page and remove all filters from main table. After the site has an article with synopsis of the purpose of the data. The bottom right part of the site displays the table with all the information from the research. The bottom left part provide the user with ability to filter the data based on five parameters: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. To filter the user just need to enter a value on each of the filter boxes (see image 2) as shown in the placeholder text. The user may filter by 1, 5 or any combinations of parameters the user decides.
